Example Stan Notebooks
+ [Example R Stan Notebook](Notebooks/Kick-off-Prez/) by [@milkha](https://github.com/milkha), reproduced by [@tz33cu](https://github.com/tz33cu).
+ [Example IPython Stan Notebook](https://github.com/milkha/ReproducibleResearch/blob/Main/Model.ipynb) by [@milkha](https://github.com/milkha) for the same example as that in the kick-off presentation. 
+ [Probabilistic matrix factorization]
  + Probabilistic matrix factorization is a latent variable approach that is oftenly used to analyze sparse interactions over network connections. In this example notebook, we looked at user-movie Amazon movie rating pairs and fitted mixed membership stochastic blockmodel. The resulted factorization reveal clustering structure among the users and among the movies. 
+ [Splines](https://github.com/milkha/Splines_in_Stan) ([pdf](https://github.com/milkha/Splines_in_Stan/blob/master/splines_in_stan.pdf)) by [@milkha](https://github.com/milkha) for adopting spline basis function for nonparametric smoothing or regression in a Bayesian framework.
